# Programming for Data Analysis

This repository contains the notebooks developed for the **Programming for Data Analysis** course.  
It includes practical exercises focused on data exploration, visualization, clustering, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis using Python.

Each topic is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
